## What is Programming Language![Prog_img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115867551/209576267-56d7906e-a178-4571-938b-885586090499.png)
>It is language which helps to communicate with computers
{they are not able to understand human languages}
> We humans have lots of languages(english,france,amharic,arabic..)
>Computers have this languages to : Assembly,C,C++,Java,Javascript,Python,Ruby,Perl,Go…
>Programming language Help us to Write program using those languages
## What is Program?
> A program is an algorithm expressed in a programming
language.
> An algorithm is a detailed sequence of actions to perform to
accomplish some task. Named after an Iranian mathematician,
Al-Khwarizmi.
> Technically, an algorithm must reach a result after a finite
number of steps.
> With those steps Programs Do a Specific task Correctly
### What is algorithm ?
>An algorithm is a set of commands that must be followed for a computer to perform calculations or other problem-solving operations.
## Types of Programming Languages
> Computers Understand binary(0/1) , humans
don’t understand this
> SO based on the closeness of the language to
humans we classify it into 3
> The more they become low to the machine they
are faster.
> The more they become like human language they
are slower.
## A) LOW level programming language
![low_img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115867551/209576672-1c0864d9-bcb2-47db-8919-ab3b8051bf7c.jpg)
> These languages are more
like machines but with lots
of effort people can
understand them. They
are close to the hardware
of the computer.
#### Ex: Assembly
## B) High level Programming languages
![low_img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115867551/209577044-8ce3ac08-749d-4be8-8954-60698f318f81.jpg)
>They are more close to human languages.
 #### Example: Python,C++,Java,Js...
 ## C) Medium Level
>  Languages Between Low level and High level, they combine both
#### Example: C-programming
## How do high level languages work?
#### As we saw earlier we have said that computers know only binarys, and if we code with high level languages how do computers understand us?
> 1) Compilers: are tools which helps to convert the whole code to bytecode then computer will execute it
#####  Example: C,C++,Java,..
> 2) Interpreter: can directly execute the code by reading the source code line by line
##### Example: python
## Uses of Programming language
>Android Application Development
> Website Development
> Machine learning
> Artificial Intelligence
> Game Development
> Big data Technology
> Desktop software development
> Hacking tool development
## What is Python Programming?
> Python is a High level & interpreted programming language. => Very easy to learn
>It is Very SImplified language any one can write with it, also can read it.
## Uses of Python
>  Data visualization
>  Data analysis
>  Machine learning
>  Artificial intelligence
>  Back-end web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask)
>  Game development
>  Hacking Script writing
## Outputs and Comments
> On python, to display output we use keyword ‘print’
> Syntax: print(object=’’, sep=’’, end=’’)
## Comments
> This are a simple notes written on our codes those can help as to remember the function of the code or to make it simple for peoples to understand our code.
> Comments won’t be executed.
> Syntax: # This is a comment line
## Python Keywords
> Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in Python programming that have special meanings to the compiler.
![python-keywords](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115867551/209577843-e036be22-d803-4ef0-93eb-0be6ab96f032.png)
## Variables
> Variables are a value holders /containers/
> They store data
> We give some value to some word.
> example : number = 10 => from now on my python program knows the value of number is 10.
> The process of giving value to word is called Variable Declaration
> The word that holds the data is called Identifier
> We can Print value of variables by giving the identifier
>We can change value of variable in a code.
>You can print the variable with {variableName} on print keyword
>Syntax: print(f”yourtext {variable}”)
###### Remember!
> On naming the identifier:
 >a) Dont use space between words use _
 >b) Dont use numbers as identifier
## Data types
> Have you seen the data types we used on the variable slide?
> There are a lot of Data types on python
![Python-data-structure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115867551/209578054-1b4c66bb-354f-454e-85c8-dab8a1ba4616.jpg)
### A) Numeric Data type
>int(integer) - holds signed integers of non-limited length.
>float - holds floating decimal points and it's accurate up to 15 decimal places.
> complex - holds complex numbers.
> You can Identify The type of a variable with the keyword ‘type()’
### B) String Data
> String is a sequence of characters represented by either single or double quotes. For example, var = “ ” or var = ‘ ’
### C) Sequence Data
#### 1) Lists
>List is an ordered collection of similar or different types of items separated by commas and enclosed within brackets [ ]. For example, languages = ["Swift", "Java","Python"]
>To access items from a list, we use the index number (0, 1, 2 ...). For example, languages[0]
We can add/modifie objects to the list, 
#### 2) Tuple
> Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list. The only difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified.
> we use the parentheses () to store items of a tuple. For example, product = ('Xbox', 499.99)
> Similar to lists, we use the index number to access tuple items in Python 
#### 3) Dictionary data
>Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. It stores elements in key/value pairs.
     > ○ user1 = {'username':’nathan26,’password’:’p@$$word’}
         > ■ username and password = key
         > ■ nathan26 & p@$$word = value
> We use keys to retrieve the respective value. But not the other way around.
