g language
>It is language which helps to communicate with computers
{they are not able to understand human languages}
> We humans have lots of languages(english,france,amharic,arabic..)
>Computers have this languages to : Assembly,C,C++,Java,Javascript,Python,Ruby,Perl,Go…
>Programming language Help us to Write program using those languages
## What is Program?
>● A program is an algorithm expressed in a programming
language.
>● An algorithm is a detailed sequence of actions to perform to
accomplish some task. Named after an Iranian mathematician,
Al-Khwarizmi.
>● Technically, an algorithm must reach a result after a finite
number of steps.
>● With those steps Programs Do a Specific task Correctly
### What is algorithm ?
>An algorithm is a set of commands that must be followed for a computer to perform calculations or other problem-solving operations.
## Types of Programming Languages
>● Computers Understand binary(0/1) , humans
don’t understand this
>● SO based on the closeness of the language to
humans we classify it into 3
>● The more they become low to the machine they
are faster.
>● The more they become like human language they
are slower.
## A) LOW level programming language
